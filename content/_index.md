Research at the Cognitive Dynamics and Adaptability (CDA) lab focuses on how mental representations can (and why they sometimes cannot) change to reflect changes in the objects around us, how we make intuitive predictions and judgements about these objects, and how the two processes interact. To tackle these questions, we combine EEG, behavioral measures, and computational models.

The CDA lab is currently looking for postdocs for a project in collaboration with Tomer Ullman’s CoCoDev lab at Harvard; contact us if you’re interested!
