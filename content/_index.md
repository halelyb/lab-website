Research at the **_C_**_ognitive_ **_D_**_ynamics and_ **_A_**_daptability_ lab focuses on how mental representations can (and why they sometimes cannot) change to reflect changes in the objects around us, how we make intuitive predictions and judgements about these objects, and how the two processes interact. To tackle these questions, we combine EEG, behavioral measures, and computational models.

We are currently **looking for postdocs** for a project in collaboration with [Tomer Ullman](http://www.tomerullman.org)’s [CoCoDev lab](https://www.cocodev.org) at Harvard -- please reach out (_halelyb at openu dot ac dot il_) if you’re interested!
